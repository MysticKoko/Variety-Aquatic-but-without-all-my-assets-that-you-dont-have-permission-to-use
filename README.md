# Variety-Aquatic
As of today I'm reclaiming ownership of Variety Mods (Variety Aquatic, Variety Worldgen, Variety Birds, Variety API). Ownership was to be transferred over to Dr. Mystic once enough changes was to be made to the project, however after a month of waiting for them to push any code
I still the one who had to fix crashes, and bugs so as of today i'm reclaiming ownership of all mods.

Forks
Pretty much anyone can fork the project and reupload if they give credit, however, Dr Mystic and his team are not allowed to use any of the codebase of the mod that I created.
